<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project
Automation of the [DemoWebShop E-commerce](https://demowebshop.tricentis.com/) web application using Selenium, TestNG and Cucumber focuses on validating key functionalities like register account, login, add gift card to the cart, and placing an order. Selenium is employed for interacting with the web interface, while TestNG is used to manage test execution and reporting.

* Register Account: Automation scripts to simulate a user account registration with valid credentials.
* Login Functionality: Automation scripts simulate a user logging in with valid credentials.
* Add Gift Card to Cart: The script selects a product, adds it to the cart, and validates that the cart updates correctly by verifying the product count and details.
* Place Order: The automation flow proceeds to checkout, fills in the necessary shipping and payment details, and confirms the order.
